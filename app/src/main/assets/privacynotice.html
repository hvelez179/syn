        <p><b>Effective Date: April 18, 2017</b></p>
        <p>
         Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. ("Teva") is providing this notice (“Privacy Notice”) to explain our policies and practices for handling information and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. This Privacy Notice applies only to the use and collection of data collected by this ProAir Digihaler® App (“the app”) and does not apply to any other data collected by Teva or its affiliates through any other mobile app, website or other means.</p>

        <p>As used in this Privacy Notice, "we," "our" and "us" means Teva, and its related companies and affiliates.</p>

        <p><b>Collection, Use and Sharing of Your Information</b></p>
        <p>We collect and store information that you voluntarily choose to give us or enter in the app (e.g., name, address, e-mail address, mobile number, username and password, and medication information that you provide during account registration or thereafter). We also automatically collect and store data about your use of products connected to the app, including but not limited to frequency and duration of use and certain quality measures, some of which may be sensitive health information. Note, any such usage and health information stored by the product prior to being connected to the app will be imported once the product is connected to the app (e.g., as part of the pairing process) and the terms of this Privacy Notice will apply to all such imported information.</p>

        <p>We may also collect certain identifying and activity information automatically, such as your device type, Internet protocol (IP) address, device and advertising identifiers, operating system, Internet service provider, the date and time of your app use, information about the links you click and your activity within the app, and other standard log information. We also may receive error-reporting information in the event of a technical error, including the device type and version, device identifiers, the time the error occurred, the feature being used, the state of the application when the error occurred, and any communications or content provided at the time the error occurred.</p>

        <p>We may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and similar technologies to automatically collect and store any of the above information, including for the purpose of user authentication. Cookies are small bits of information that are stored by a mobile web browser. Pixel tags are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as "web beacons&rdquo; or "clear GIFs,&rdquo; that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information from your device. Our third party partners may also use cookies and similar technologies to assist us with user authentication and/or managing customer information. By using the app, you consent to our and our third party partners' use of cookies and similar technologies.</p>

        <p>We use Google Analytics, an analytics tool provided by Google, to collect and analyze information about your use of the app. This information is collected and processed by Google and may identify, for example, the name of the app, which parts of the app you visit, the frequency and duration of those visits, how you navigate within the app, which elements of the app you interact with and other usage data. Google Analytics uses cookies and other identifiers to identify you each time you use the app. We may use the information collected by Google Analytics for research purposes and to improve and/or personalize the app. For more information about the data Google collects and how it uses that data, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.</p>

        <p>We may use the data we collect, including your personally identifiable information, to provide you with services that you request (including push notifications), to personalize product or service information, to provide you with additional information about our products and services, to optimize or improve our products, services and operations, to manage customer information across Teva platforms and services, and to detect, investigate or prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal. We may also share your personally identifiable information with affiliates, our agents, contractors, or business partners in order that they may perform services for us in connection with the app.</p>

        <p>While the information we collect will be retained for a commercially reasonable time by Teva for administrative, liability, and archival purposes, your personally identifying information is not shared with a third-party, other than (i) as specifically requested by you, (ii) as required by law, (iii) to protect and defend the rights of Teva, the app, the users of the app, (iv) as incident to a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy, or similar event, (v) under circumstances we believe reasonably necessary to protect the personal safety of users of Teva products and services, the app, or the public, or (vi) as otherwise described in this Privacy Notice.</p>

        <p>We conduct research and analysis on users' demographics, interests and behaviors based upon information provided to or collected by us during use of the app and we may also combine your information with information collected from other individuals to produce aggregated statistical information. Aggregated data does not include personally identifiable information. We use this demographic information, such as the percentage of male or female visitors, or the percentage of visitors within certain age brackets, to gain user insights or improve the app or related services. We also may share this aggregated information, which does not include personally identifiable information, with third parties.</p>

        <p><b>Safety, Efficacy and Quality</b></p>
        <p>You consent to Teva's use and disclosure of your personal information in the event we become aware of an adverse event or product complaint in order to (a) comply with any reporting requirements under applicable law, and (b) contact you for further information about the adverse event or product complaint.</p>

        <p><b>Communications</b></p>
        <p>We may collect your contact information through this app to provide you product, safety or other related information or requested information or services. By providing your contact information to us, you hereby consent to receive electronic communications, including email communications, from Teva regarding the app and other related matters. You may opt-out of receiving electronic communications at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in the communication or by sending an email to USPrivacy@tevapharm.com</p>

        <p><b>Account Linking</b></p>

        <p>The app may offer functionality in which you can invite another individual (e.g. a healthcare professional or a family member) to use our app or, more specifically, to connect to your account and view your personal information and product usage data. If you choose to use this functionality, we will ask you for the individual's name and e-mail address and other related information. An e-mail will be sent to the individual inviting him or her to use the app and/or connect to your account. You are responsible for verifying the contact information you provide, and for verifying the identity of the individual that you invite to connect to your account. You may terminate such individual's access to your account at any time but it is your responsibility to ensure such individual has returned or deleted your personal data.</p>

        <p><b>Protecting Your Information</b></p>
        <p>We have enacted commercially reasonable physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to secure your information that is stored on our systems. You should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. In addition, to prevent unauthorized access to your information, the app or any portion thereof, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the correct use of information, we strongly recommend that you password protect your device and refrain from providing any third party with unsupervised access to your device.</p>

        <p><b>Special Note Regarding App Use By Children</b></p>
        <p>Teva does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. This app is not intended or designed to attract children. If you are under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to Teva. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under 13, please contact us at USPrivacy@tevapharm.com.</p>

        <p><b>Links to Websites and Services</b></p>
        <p>As a resource to our visitors, Teva may provide links to websites or other services. Please be aware that these websites and services are not covered under this Privacy Notice. We suggest that when linking to a website or service, you always read the applicable privacy notice before volunteering any personally identifiable information. Likewise, any data you backup to a third party server (e.g., your iCloud or Google account) is subject to that third party's privacy notice.</p>

        <p><b>Geolocation Data</b></p>
        <p>Some features of this app may make use of your device's geolocation data and the app may therefore access your device's geolocation capabilities (e.g., GPS) for this purpose. We may use or disclose to third parties such geolocation information, including the Wi-Fi routers closest to you or the geographical coordinates of your device's location, for the purpose of providing these features. Although Teva may use or disclose geolocation data, we are not capable of assisting in an emergency.</p>

        <p><b>Changes to this Privacy Notice</b></p>
        <p>Teva may, from time to time in its sole discretion, change or modify this Privacy Notice to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. Any changes or modifications will be effective upon posting of the revisions on the app. At any given time, your access and use of the app and provision of information is governed by the Privacy Notice then in effect. Teva may post changes or modifications to referenced notices and guidelines without your approval, and may determine whether and when any such changes apply to you. Your continued use of the app following Teva's posting of any changes or modifications will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications. Should you not wish to be bound by the revised Privacy Notice, you may not use or access the app. We will provide notice to you if these changes are material and, where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent.</p>

        <p><b>Feedback</b></p>
        <p>Comments, suggestions, or other communications sent by you to us are deemed to be non-confidential. We have no obligations of any kind in relation to such comments, suggestions, or communications and are free to use or distribute them in any way, including in relation to the administration, update, or improvement of the app, without compensation to the author, sender, or any other party.</p>

        <p>By using the app, you signify your assent to this Privacy Notice. Should you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Notice you may contact us at:</p>
