        <p><b>10.	Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</b></p>
        
        <p><b>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.  BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE.</b></p>
        
        <p>
        In order to expedite the resolution and control the cost of disputes, Teva and you agree that any legal or equitable claim, dispute, action or proceeding arising from or related to the Service ("Dispute") will be resolved as follows to the fullest extent permitted by law:</p>
        
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>a.	<u>Notice of Dispute</u>.  In the event of a Dispute, you or Teva must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and a proposed solution.  You must send any Notice of Dispute by first class U.S. Mail to Teva at Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 425 Privet Road, Horsham, PA 19454.  Teva will send any Notice of Dispute to you by email to the email address that you have provided to Teva.  You and Teva will attempt to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within sixty days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After sixty days, you or Teva may commence arbitration.</li>
            <li>b.	<u>Small Claims Court</u>.  You may choose to litigate any Dispute in small claims court (or the equivalent) in your home jurisdiction or in North Wales, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, if the Dispute meets all the requirements to be heard in small claims court.  You may litigate in small claims court whether or not you first negotiated informally.</li>
            <li>c.	<u>Binding Arbitration and Governing Law</u>.  If the Dispute is not resolved by informal negotiation or in small claims court, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final and binding except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act.  Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Terms and any Dispute that might arise between you and Teva shall be governed by the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</li>
            <li>d.	<u>Class Action Waiver</u>.  Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis and you agree to give up the ability to participate in a class action. Neither you nor Teva will seek to have any Dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</li>
            <li>e.	<u>Arbitration Procedures</u>.  Any arbitration shall be seated in Pennsylvania and will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "Rules") in effect at the time the Dispute is filed.  The Rules are available online at <a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules/searchrules/rulesdetail?doc=ADRSTAGE2021424">https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules/searchrules/rulesdetail?doc=ADRSTAGE2021424</a>.  The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by Teva that an in-person hearing is appropriate.  Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.  If you and Teva are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the arbitrator or the AAA. The arbitrator shall have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of the Terms, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.  You and Teva agree that regardless of any law to the contrary, the arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive or exemplary damages.  The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator’s decision shall follow these Terms and be final and binding.</li>
            <li>f.	<u>Arbitration Fees</u>.  Whoever files the arbitration pays the initial filing fee.  If Teva files, Teva pays.  If you file, you pay unless you get a fee waiver under the applicable arbitration rules. All other fees will be allocated as provided by the rules of the arbitration firm and applicable law. Each party will bear the expense of that party’s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.</li>
            <li>g.	<u>Temporary Injunctive Relief</u>.  Prior to the appointment of an arbitrator, either party may seek temporary injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction without waiving its right to arbitration.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p><b>11.	Miscellaneous</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>a.	<u>Governing Law.</u>  You agree that these Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of Pennsylvania without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.</li>
            <li>b.	<u>Severability.</u>  If any provision of these Terms is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed, with the remainder of the Terms remaining in full force and effect.  If the entire agreement to arbitrate is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the parties agree to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law that any Dispute relating to your use of the Service or these Terms shall be commenced and heard in the appropriate court in Pennsylvania.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within Pennsylvania.</li>
            <li>c.	<u>Entire Agreement; Waiver. </u> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Teva, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and Teva.  Our failure to enforce any provisions of these Terms or respond to a violation by any party does not waive our right to subsequently enforce any terms or conditions of the Terms or respond to any violations.</li>
            <li>d.	<u>Independent Contractor.</u>  You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Teva as a result of these Terms or your access to and use of the Service.</li>
            <li>e.	<u>Information, Complaints or Questions.</u>  If you have a question or complaint regarding the Terms, please write to Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., Attention:  Legal Department, 425 Privet Road, Horsham, PA 19454.  California residents may reach the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by mail at 1625 North Market Blvd., Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210.</li>
