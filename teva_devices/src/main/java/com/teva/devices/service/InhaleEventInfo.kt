/**
 * Represents the information specific to inhale events.
 *
 * @property inhaleStartOffset Time delta from open event to inhale event in units of 0.1 seconds.
 * @property inhaleDuration Duration of inhalation in milliseconds.
 * @property inhalePeak Peak calculated flow in units of 100ml/minute.
 * @property inhalePeakOffset Time delta from inhale event to peak inhale in (ms).
 * @property inhaleVolume Calculated total inhale volume in ml.
 * @property status Flags indicate state of the inhale event.
 * @property isValidInhale A value indicating whether the inhalation was valid.
 * @property contextFlags Context flags indicating which optional features are implemented by the inhaler.
 * @property closeOffset Time delta in seconds from device open event to device closed event.
 * @property doseId Unique ID for this dose. This allows multiple inhalation events to be associated with a single dose.
 * @property upperThresholdOffset Time delta from open event to the detection of the flow above upper threshold.
 * @property upperThresholdDuration Duration of detected flow above upper threshold.
