/**
 * This enum contains air quality terms that correspond to ranges of air quality indexes.
 * Unknown : Not specified
 * Good : Air quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk.
 * Moderate : Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.
 * UnhealthyForSensitiveGroups : Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is not likely to be affected.
 * Unhealthy : Everyone may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.
 * VeryUnhealthy : Health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected.
 * Hazardous : Health alert: everyone may experience more serious health effects.
